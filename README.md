# 𝜏 Token Authenticated Upload

Tau (𝜏) is a simple [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) base uploading service that authenticates users via (eupload sent) secure tokens generated by [itsdangerous](https://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/); the frontend is based on [filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/).

## The idea and flow

This tool is primarily intended to collect programming assignments from a list
of known students without the hassle of setting up (and administering) a password authentication system (relying instead on pre-existing email authentication).

First of all one configures the service with a list of *user id*s (usually the
badge number) and corresponding *email*s; then instruct the students to request
their upload URL by entering their *user id*

it it corresponds to a registered student, the system will acknowledge it

<img alt="acknowledge" src="screenshots/acknowledge.png" width="320px" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

and send an email to the student, containing an *action* button to submit the files

<img alt="email" src="screenshots/email.png" width="320px" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

finally, the students uploads his solutions

The uploaded assignments will be stored in a separate folder per every student.
